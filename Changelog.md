## Mods added:

## Mods removed:
- [Structory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/structory) - This and the towers addon I don't think have ever actually worked. They don't appear in the modlist so something is preventing them from loading I think. It's honestly not worth my time to figure it out.
